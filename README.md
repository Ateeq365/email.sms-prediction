What Is Email Spam?
Spam emails are typically:

Unsolicited commercial messages

Phishing attempts

Malware or scam content

Mass emails sent without user consent

üß† What Is Email Spam Prediction?
It's a machine learning (ML) classification problem where each email is labeled as either:

Spam (1)

Not Spam or Ham (0)

The goal is to train a model that can predict this label for new, unseen emails.

üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?
Data Collection

Datasets like the Enron dataset or the SpamAssassin dataset are commonly used.

Emails are labeled as spam or ham.

Preprocessing

Text cleaning: Remove punctuation, numbers, HTML tags.

Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.

Stop-word removal: Remove common but unhelpful words (like ‚Äúthe,‚Äù ‚Äúis‚Äù).

Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base forms.

Vectorization: Convert text to numerical form using techniques like:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF

Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

Modeling

Classical ML Models:

Naive Bayes (very popular for spam)

Logistic Regression

SVM

Random Forest

Deep Learning Models:

LSTM or GRU (for sequence modeling)

Transformers (like BERT)

Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix to check false positives/negatives

Deployment

The trained model is integrated into email servers or apps to classify incoming emails in real time.

‚öñÔ∏è Challenges
Evolving spam techniques (spammers obfuscate words or add images)

Class imbalance (more ham than spam)

False positives (misclassifying legit emails as spam can be costly)
